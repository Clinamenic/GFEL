## Initiative Type  
- Local DAOs  
- Governance Experiments  

## Local Resonance  
PDX DAO functions as a permissionless coalition of local DAOs. Anyone can create a DAO in the PDX DAO ecosystem and any DAO can join the ecosystem. Membership eligibility is a social construct emergent from the relationships of participating orgs. As we grow as a coalition, we will be building out a decentralized governance model with an eye toward an on-chain democratic confederation.

[Ethereal Forest](https://twitter.com/EthForestDAO) is currently engaging in research and community outreach to work toward this participatory cityDAO infrastructure.

## Core Activities  
- Regular Ethereum meetups  
- Ongoing perspective sharing from a local-cosmo contingency  
- Future goal: DAO-curious civic education programming

## Core Tools & Practices  
- [DAOHaus](https://daohaus.club), Gnosis Safe, Telegram  
- Open community meetings and co-working sessions

## Needs & Offers  
**Needs:** Participation! Regular access to a community space that can serve regular meetups and co-working.
**Offers:** Consultation on civic DAOs early experiments and research, and how Ethereum Localism is suited to enable the mass onboarding of humans and fiat capital, and shape the future of human coordination.
