Explore our curated collection of resources to help you learn about, implement, and advocate for Ethereum Localism in your community.

## Ethereum
Ethereum is more than a blockchain—it’s a substrate for shared imagination, coordination, and experimentation. This section offers foundational pieces on what Ethereum is, how it works, and why it might matter to communities seeking autonomy, cooperation, and regenerative alternatives to extractive systems.

- [Learn About Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/learn/) – A beginner-friendly guide to understanding Ethereum and how it works.
- [Introduction to Ethereum Localism](/introduction)

## Ethereum Localism Playbooks
Ethereum Localism is not a doctrine—it’s a living design space. These playbooks offer practical entry points for organizing locally using Web3 tools and cosmo-local principles. From starting a Fun DAO to hosting a GFEL, you’ll find scaffolding to help translate shared values into situated action.

- [Ethereum Localism Action Kit](/introduction/action-kit) - Practical tools, templates, and guidance to start creating local impact.
- [Ethereum Localism Implementation Guides](/library/Implementation-Guides)
- [Local Regen Guide #1](https://greenpill.network/pdf/local-regen-guide.pdf) – by greenpill.network. A practical handbook that empowers local communities to create regenerative systems through open-source collaboration and Web3 tools.

## Regenerative Finance & Commons Economy
Regeneration begins with relationship—to land, to people, to value itself. This section gathers frameworks and experiments in building economies of care, trust, and reciprocity. It includes both theory and practice on local currencies, commons governance, and financial infrastructures that nourish rather than extract.

- [Regen Foundation](https://regen.foundation) – Supports ecological regeneration through Web3 tools and community-led initiatives.  
- [Regen Commons](https://regencommons.com) – A digital space fostering collaboration for regenerative finance and land stewardship.  
- [Eight Forms of Capital](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Eight_Forms_of_Capital) – A framework that expands value beyond financial capital to include social, cultural, and ecological capital.  
- [Grassroots Economics](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org) – A non-profit foundation focused on community currencies and local economic empowerment.  
- [Commons Economy Roadmap](https://www.commonseconomy.org/?v=28e89012f4b0491383940ca7ba568403) – A guide for transitioning from extractive systems to commons-based, cooperative economies.  
- [Ostrom's Eight Principles for Successful Commons](https://earthbound.report/2018/01/15/elinor-ostroms-8-rules-for-managing-the-commons/) – A summary of Nobel laureate Elinor Ostrom’s principles for sustainable management of shared resources.  
- [Commons-Based Peer Production](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Commons-Based_Peer_Production) – An overview of decentralized, collaborative production enabled by digital networks.

## Cosmolocal Governance
How do we govern across difference, distance, and scale? Cosmolocal governance explores ways to balance local autonomy with global solidarity—merging ancestral wisdom, digital tools, and mutual accountability. Here you’ll find models, questions, and protocols for stewarding shared power and resources across networks.

- [Open Civics](https://www.opencivics.co) – Tools and frameworks for building more participatory and inclusive civic processes.  
- [Metagov](https://metagov.org) – A research collective developing governance infrastructure for digital communities and DAOs.  
- [DAOHaus](https://daohaus.club) – A platform for creating and managing DAOs using Moloch smart contracts.  
- [Gardens.fund](https://www.gardens.fund) – DAO infrastructure for communities to govern shared resources with conviction voting.  
- [Neighborhoods](https://neighbourhoods.network) – A framework for building online communities with composable governance and cultural protocols.  
- [Community Rule](https://communityrule.info) – A simple tool for designing and sharing governance models for groups and communities.

## Participatory Funding
Funding is coordination. Who decides what gets resourced, and how? This section explores experiments in participatory, transparent, and collective funding—from quadratic voting to public goods games to locally rooted grants. These tools can help communities fund what matters, together.

- [Easy Retro PGF](https://easyretropgf.xyz) – A lightweight platform for running retroactive public goods funding rounds.  
- [Gitcoin Grants](https://grants.gitcoin.co) – A crowdfunding platform that uses quadratic funding to support open-source projects.  
- [Allo IRL](https://irl.allo.capital) – A tool for running participatory funding experiments in real-life communities using Allo protocol.

## Community
Movements grow through relationships. Ethereum Localism is part of a larger, interconnected web of communities building regenerative, commons-based, and cosmo-local futures. These are friends and fellow travelers—each experimenting with new ways to live, govern, and coordinate together.

Explore these communities to find kinship, inspiration, and invitations to collaborate.

- [Regens Unite](https://www.regensunite.earth/) – A convergence of creators, technologists, and community weavers organizing immersive gatherings around regeneration, coordination, and trust.
- [Crypto Commons Association](https://www.crypto-commons.org/) – A think/do tank in the Austrian Alps cultivating research, residency, and retreat spaces for crypto-commons, post-capitalist tech, and open knowledge infrastructures.
