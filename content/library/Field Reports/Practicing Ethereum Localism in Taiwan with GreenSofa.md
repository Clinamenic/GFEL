# GreenSofa (Greenpill Taiwan)  
**By GreenSofa Team**  
*Taiwan, 2023–2025*

## Summary  
GreenSofa, also known as Greenpill Taiwan, is a local initiative cultivating Ethereum public goods culture in Taiwan. Founded in 2023 under the umbrella of FAB DAO ([Twitter](https://x.com/FAB_DAO), [Website](https://fabdao.world/)), the group has transitioned through three stewardships, each building upon the last to deepen community-rooted funding, education, and infrastructure. Through Gitcoin, Giveth, Hypercerts, and more, GreenSofa has brought real funding and public goods tooling into Taiwan’s civic tech scene, particularly through partnerships with g0v and local NGOs.

## Context  
Operating in Taiwan—a globally recognized hub for digital democracy and civic tech—GreenSofa (an iconic name, voted for by the community) bridges Ethereum-based public goods infrastructure with grassroots organizing. Taiwan’s unique ecosystem combines an open civic culture (exemplified by g0v.tw), strong digital infrastructure, and increasing openness to blockchain regulation. However, blockchain adoption in public goods remains low, revealing a key opportunity for GreenSofa: to bring accessible, community-led Ethereum tools to local actors who may not yet engage with Web3.

> Green Sofa embodies the spirit originated from FAB DAO's first principle: Be fun and not exhausting ([source](https://snapshot.org/#/fabdao.eth/proposal/0x8d10709297c7f530543ddd7550c72f585169d519b18884bab92710284c003769)). While we are serious about making contributions, we also take time to relax on the sofa and build connections with our members.

Over the past two years, Taiwan has also emerged as a regional Web3 hub, hosting events like Funding the Commons, ETHGlobal Taipei, and d/acc Day. GreenSofa participates in and builds upon this momentum, localizing tools like Gitcoin QF and Hypercerts for civic tech projects.

## What Happened  
GreenSofa’s milestones reflect a blend of experimentation, education, and deepening impact:

- **DAO Evolution:**  
  Three distinct stewardship phases—Stanley, Denken, and current steward Swift Evo—have matured GreenSofa’s governance and strategic focus:
  
  - Stanley ([Twitter](https://x.com/shi79536?s=21)) laid a solid foundation for Green Sofa. Under his leadership, **trust and communication protocols with FAB DAO and the Greenpill Network were established**, **internal governance frameworks (e.g., proposal discussion, voting mechanisms, regular weekly meeting) were built**, **GIVETH verification** was completed, and **critical infrastructure was launched, like the multi-signature wallet** (to securely manage funds).
  
  - Denken ([Twitter](https://x.com/denkeni)) brought a phase of experimentation and outreach, launching **[Karma GAP profiles](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/greensofa)**, **[minting NFTs](https://www.akaswap.com/akaobj/25336)** for contributors, and conducting **[impact surveys](https://hackmd.io/@greensofa/quarterly-surveys)**. Under his term, GreenSofa began actively exploring its **identity and positioning—both within FAB DAO and across the international Ethereum Localism community**.

  - With a clear identity now established, Swift Evo ([Twitter](https://x.com/swiftevo1)) is focused on **deepening our local-global connections**. We are expanding our network through cross-regional partnerships and aligning Green Sofa more strategically with the broader Web3 and Ethereum localism ecosystem, while strengthening ties with **local Taiwanese NGOs, educators, and public goods builders**.

- **Global Crowdfunding, Local Impact:**  
  Raised stablecoin funding via Gitcoin, Giveth, and Hypercerts, then redirected it toward civic tech projects like g0v Hackathon, often converting to fiat to respect local workflows.

- **Cross-Regional Collaborations:**  
  Facilitated dialogue and AMAs across Chinese-speaking public goods communities, working with MattersLab, Blocktrend, DeSciAsia, and more.

- **Onchain Reputation & Verification:**  
  Employed tools like SAFE, [Karma GAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/greensofa), and Hypercerts to manage treasury, verify impact, and build a credible funding pipeline.

- **Follow-Up & Human-Centered Design:**  
  Directly supported 18 local public goods projects with onboarding, tracking, and funding—all while reducing technical barriers.

## Reflections  
- **Tooling vs. Trust:**  
  GreenSofa learned that while Ethereum tools provide structure and funding, local engagement relies heavily on cultural translation and relationship-building. Communication—not just code—is key.

- **IRL Still Matters:**  
  In-person workshops and events are far more effective for onboarding than digital materials alone. GreenSofa now prioritizes real-world interaction for trust-building and education.

- **Simplify to Localize:**  
  Tools like easyRetroPGF proved too complex for many Taiwanese civic groups. Instead, GreenSofa developed a model where global funds are stewarded locally, sometimes off-chain, but always transparently.

## Next Steps  
GreenSofa is sponsoring the **g0v SofaSoGood Hackath67n** in May 2025, aiming to:

- Integrate Web3 public goods tools into local civic workflows  
- Onboard g0v projects into Gitcoin and Giveth ecosystems  
- Act as a bridge for global donors seeking credible local projects  
- Continue follow-ups and support through surveys, onboarding, and education

Ultimately, GreenSofa seeks to co-develop a hybrid model of Ethereum localism—where global infrastructure meets community-defined stewardship.
