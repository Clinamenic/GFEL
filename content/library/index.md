## Emerging Themes

These thematic clusters represent the next phase of Ethereum Localism’s evolution. New sections will be created as more entries and prototypes accumulate.

**Applied Cosmo-Localism**  
Living examples where cosmo-local principles meet on-the-ground application — bridging the global commons with bioregional action.  

**Regenerative Financial Infrastructure**  
Innovations in commons-based finance, bioregional investment systems, and post-extractive capital architectures.  

**Bioregional Finance Prototypes**  
Frameworks like [Bioregional Financing Facilities (BFFs)](BioFi-Project.md) that operationalize decentralized finance in service to place, ecology, and culture.

## Contribute  

The Ethereum Localism Library is a living, growing commons — and your voice is vital.  

Whether you're experimenting with local DAOs, stewarding bioregional ecosystems, crafting regenerative finance models, designing new governance patterns, or weaving culture through story and art — your insights, field notes, and frameworks belong here.

If you have knowledge, experiments, or creative works to share that align with Ethereum Localism’s spirit of applied cosmo-localism and decentralized solidarity, we invite you to contribute. Together, we are weaving the intellectual and practical foundations for the worlds to come.
