The most recent gathering of [a General Forum on Ethereum Localism (GFEL) in Boulder](library/GFEL/GFEL-2025-Boulder-Documentation) was more than a conference—it was a living inquiry into how we build systems of care, coordination, and community in a time of both precarity and possibility.

As you’ll see in the recap, Ethereum Localism is not a fixed ideology, rather it's a collaborative design space—where tools like DAOs, local currencies, and cosmo-local infrastructure are combined with deeply rooted local action to be wielded not for profit alone, but in service of regeneration, reciprocity, and collective resilience.
