## Civic Utilities and Commons Architectures

It's easy to imagine that the world is neatly divided up into for-profit and non-profit activities. We're conditioned to go after "mine" and make donations to take care of some less fortunate "other." But what if we could go after ours? What if not every part of our local economy was based on a profit motive? What if we cut out the middle man profiting on our basic human needs?

These are the questions that civic utilities and commons architectures aim to address.

Through dynamic, self-governing communal ownership of shared infrastructure, we can use the power of coordination and aligned incentives to provide utility and value that has traditionally been reserved for the private sector.

These civic infrastructures serve communities, cooperatives, and the commons by supporting the creation of value without extracting a profit, able to lower costs through the participatory means of cooperativism, volunteerism, and mutual responsibility.

Civic utilities increase the quality of life of our community through agent-centric coordination, enabling members of our communities to contribute what they have and receive what they need.

To illustrate this concept in practice, let's take a look at a case study currently underway in Boulder, CO.

## Case Study: The Regen Hub

The COVID-19 pandemic rapidly accelerated an existing pattern of "work from home," a trend that initially seemed liberatory for many as a means to avoid stale corporate workplace culture. But a few years into this new paradigm, after the peak of the pandemic had subsided, the lack of camaraderie, connection, and in-person collaboration had taken a toll.

Knowledge and tech workers faced a choice: continuing working from home in their bedroom or home office, attempt to find an increasingly rare and often noisy or crowded public third space like a library or coffee house, or pay exorbitant fees to get a desk at one of the many new co-working spaces that had sprung up in many urban and suburban places.

An alternative was needed, and all it took was a spontaneous post into a group chat of an existing high trust network of friends in the Boulder decentralized tech scene to realize that many peers and allies were in a similar situation, seeking a co-working space that was community-centered, affordable, and values-aligned. Already knowledgable in the principles and infrastructures of decentralized coordination, this group of friends quickly realized that a simple DAO with a minimal governance structure and a set of operational volunteer roles could provide the entire community with a low cost alternative to corporate co-working spaces.

Using one of the friends' LLC, they were able to secure a 2 thousand square feet of office space in downtown Boulder, CO, taking advantage of the depressed commercial real estate market to lock it in at an incredibly low monthly rate. Using a friend's truck, they filled their new office space with furniture they were able to find for free on Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace. Another friend donated monitors from an old office space they had to close down a few months prior. Some of the more network-savvy of the friends bought a new router and configured the network, expensing the bigger costs to the DAO treasury. Others brought in plants, art, books, and zines.

The space was starting to come to life. A participatory governance model was established with all key decisions occurring at weekly family meetings.

Six months into this experiment, the community around the Regen Hub has grown, with weekly happy hours hosted at 4:20pm every Friday serving as a schelling point for the social impact tech scene in Boulder, strengthening the network by providing a reliable third space for community gatherings, workshops, and events.

To help you create your own version of a thriving third space, below is a simple playbook to help you get started.

## What Is A Regen Hub?

A Regen Hub is a community third space that utilizes revenue from co-working membership to provide a physical hub for localists, innovators, and change-makers to converge, coordinate, and collaborate, strengthening local networks by increasing the number of spontaneous interactions between aligned individuals. Co-working membership is not limited to individuals working in the impact space but the hub itself is explicitly oriented to regenerating our communities and commons via decentralized networks.

Regen Hubs are deeply connected to the localist movement, implying a highly contextual identity based on the emergent local contexts wherever they're located. For that reason, Regen Hubs can look and feel very different depending on the local social ecology in which they emerge, but what unites Regen Hubs is their provisioning of novel types of third spaces that utilize coordination and co-working revenue to provide value to their extended communities.

The concept of a "third space," originally coined by sociocultural theorist Homi K. Bhabha, describes a space where different cultures, perspectives, or paradigms intersect to create something new and transformative. In its standard definition, the third space is a hybrid zone where boundaries blur, fostering dialogue, negotiation, and the blending of ideas or identities.

In the context of a Regen Hub, a "third space" retains these foundational principles while expanding their application to systemic innovation and regeneration. A Regeb Hub is a participatory environment where diverse local groups—ranging from individuals and communities to organizations and ecosystems—co-create shared solutions that transcend traditional frameworks and ideologies.

These spaces embody the principles of commons governance and open protocols, emphasizing inclusivity, mutual care, and ecological regeneration. Regen Hubs serve as experimental community spaces for prototyping new governance models, community-driven economies, and participatory structures. They are neither entirely formal nor informal but operate as flexible, adaptive zones that prioritize collaboration, creativity, and collective flourishing.

## The Regen Hub Playbook

### Step 1: Trust

Like all civic utilities and commons architectures, at the foundation of the formation of a Regen Hub is a high trust network of friends and allies able to lean in and contribute to a shared effort for mutual benefit.

A classic challenge in any commons-based effort is the problem of free-loaders. Free loaders latch onto collective efforts to extract where others contribute. Beginning with a high trust network of friends and allies is critical to ensure that everyone participates, adds value, and can be trusted to steward common pool resources.

Start by identifying a core group of friends with pre-existing relationships, trust, and mutuality. Invite those folks into a group chat to get them onboard. A great way to begin developing a trust network is to start by hosting regular meet ups at the intersection of your desired community's focus and values.

Giving plenty of time to build these trust networks is critical to ensure the individuals you build your Regen Hub with are sufficiently aligned and connected to make it through inevitable challenges, setbacks, or conflicts. This core group will create the "social membrane" or barrier, able to vet new participants based on their general alignment with the vibe of your core. New members should be vouched for by existing members. If no one can vouch for a new applicant, consider inviting them to your weekly meet-up or social hour to vet their general vibe and alignment with the space.

### Step 2: Procurement

Finding commercial real estate requires a few key factors: passing a credit check and signing a lease. Identify who in your core group has the best credit or a legal entity that can sign on behalf of your group. Setting initial agreements will be very important to create the security and trust required for the individual using their legal entity to feel confident in entering into a lease contract on behalf of your hub.

Work with a local commercial real estate agent to find a space. Alternative arrangements can be made with non-commercial or existing community spaces, but those relationships can often be harder to manage than traditional transactional ones. Ideally, find a space that can accommodate a range of revenue streams from private offices (higher contribution), shared offices (medium contribution), and common space for hot desks (lower contribution). A central location is key but tradeoffs may be made to find a space with the right affordances.

Create a multi-signature wallet with your core founding team and raise the appropriate amount for the initial month's rent, security deposit, and basic utilities. Transfer those funds to the LLC signing the contract with the landlord and secure the space. Wait to sign a contract on the space until you've put together enough funds to provide a safety net for your space, ideally equivalent to the initial start-up costs and 1-2 months rent to ensure a stable footing as you navigate the rapid development of your core operational and financial systems.

Once the space has been secured, utilize available resources to assemble the basic infrastructure of desks, tables, monitors, and anything you might need for a small kitchenette. Most of these things can be found for free on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace if you're patient and able to move quickly as new items become available. Some hard costs are inevitable so an early process for reimbursements will be one of the most important initial governance protocols to establish.

### Step 3: Governance, Membership, and Roles

Now that your space is coming to life, you'll need a core council that meets regularly to discuss new members, plan events, evaluate progress, and approve reimbursements. This core council should start with a trusted core of committed members but can grow over time to any co-working member interested in participating in governance.
