## **ETHLocal**

*Note: ETH Local was conceived in 2021 but never realized. The following context was provided by one of its creators:*
- *ETHLocal was meant to be a network of local activation of ESG projects supported by EVM tech, Radical Democracy principles (QV, QF, Harberger Tax etc) and grassroot initiatives.*
- *The network is not strictly local, but creates bridges where local chapters had ESG similar "issues": e.g. two cities in different countries, but both close to rivers may share ESG 14 "Clean Waters".*
- *The scope was to leverage offline bonds to online bridged networks, local PA and grassroots economics.*
- *We would take example from initiatives like Downtown Stimulus, where local citizen could stake value to local NGOs, businesses and initiatives using EVM tech*
- *We then tried to create "Citadels", a network of eco-villages with a tech interest that could interack with "Pilgrims", digital nomads and devs eager to go and live in those villages, while putting their skills to the citadel's benefit. Pilgrims acquire levels as they grow reputation and experiences.*

2021 Residencies Round #1  

### What is ETHLocal?

Our mission is to create a self-governing network of grassroot projects, creative hubs and communities dedicated to environmental, social and economic regeneration. We aim at empowering this network by iterating projects of local impact developed on the Ethereum Blockchain. In this initial phase, we start by launching a tech-residency program for Spring/Summer 2021. ETHLocal is a Decentralized Flexible Organization (DFO), governed by LOCAL ERC20 Tokens. 

### Who are Pilgrims?

Pilgrims are those, amongst the crypto community of developers, designers and innovators, who believe in the true power of decentralization and spend their time and energies in writing code, building solutions, organizing events and supporting each other in the journey towards a social transformation. Digital nomads become Pilgrims as they enter their first ETHLocal residency, and can level up their status by accomplishing more ETHLocal residencies as well as taking on ETHLocal bounties.


### What are Citadels?

The ETHLocal network is built upon Citadels: the very places and their communities where this iteration happens. By hosting ETHLocal residencies, locations become Citadels and earn LOCAL tokens representing voting power in the ETHLocal DFO. Citadels can level up their status by hosting more residencies.

  
### How do the residencies work?

Every Citadel joining the program will host a Pilgrim for a minimum stay of 14 days. They will provide their Pilgrim with food and accommodation. During the stay, the Pilgrim will develop her/his project for the Citadel. Projects can have different scientific, social and economic purposes: e.g. they can be aimed at implementing Dapps (decentralized apps) for the Citadel’s specific needs as well as for ETHLocal general goals, or providing the local community with an educational program about Web3 and blockchain. At the end of the residency, the final outcome of the residency provided by the Pilgrim will end up in the ETHLocal Github repository. Any kind of revenue stream derived from the residency’s project will be split among Pilgrim, Citadel and ETHLocal in percentages to be agreed case by case.  


### What’s in it for Citadels?

Citadels will be given a unique opportunity to access valuable tech and knowledge contributions and profit from engaging with an international network of developers and startups, who might become returning customers. ETHLocal will also grant Citadels with different forms of funding and incentives, in stable-coins and LOCAL tokens, for every residency that they will host.


### What’s in it for Pilgrims?

Selected Pilgrims will be granted a one-of-a-kind experience in some of the most amazing and inspiring communities in Europe, as well as the access to the local and regional funding networks to eventually follow up with their residencies’ work. A final evaluation of their residency’s outcome will also grant Pilgrims with a reward of LOCAL tokens, thus boosting their reputation in the ETHLocal and ETHEREUM communities.


### LOCAL-based Reputation System

Citadels and Pilgrims can earn LOCALs mainly via residencies, but also via occasional ETHLocal bounties and calls-to-action. Earning LOCALs provides them with Badges, Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) representing level upgrades in the ETHLocal ecosystem. The higher the level reached, the higher the reputation and possibilities of action in ETHLocal governance and future financial success.


### Examples of Badges for Citadels:

1000 LOCALs - “Windmill Tower” 

2000 LOCALs - “Sun Powered Bastion”

3000 LOCALs - “Cold Fusion Abbey”

5000 LOCALs - “Prana Pantheon”


### Example of Badges for Pilgrims:

100 LOCALs - “Novice”

200 LOCALs - “Librarian”

300 LOCALs - “Ranger”

500 LOCALs - “Shaman” 

Badges will provide the Citadels and Pilgrims with enhanced long-term governance, financial and interaction possibilities. We will dedicate the first months of 2021 designing them.


### Residencies Funding

ETHLocal offers Citadels three types of incentives to support the residencies’s expenses:

1. FULL StableCoin grant: the Citadel will be granted a fixed amount of stable-coins (DAIs) per day of residency. Stable-coins are tokens whose value is tight to USD or EUR, and are exchangeable against them on most crypto exchanges. ETHLocal provides up to the equivalent of EUR 14 / day to each residency.  
      
    
2. MIXED StableCoin/LOCAL grant: the Citadel will be granted a basic amount of stable-coins per day of residency ( EUR 7/day) plus a total of 500 LOCALs.  
      
    
3. FULL LOCAL grant: the Citadel will be granted a total amount of 1000 LOCALs, thus granting the Citadel with the first “Windmill Tower” Badge.
