The idea for *ethereumlocalism.xyz* was seeded during the first General Forum on Ethereum Localism [(GFEL)](library/GFEL) in 2023, where we learned that the meme of Ethereum Localism was strongly resonant when there was a dedicated space to hold and nurture it. The forum revealed a growing interest in maintaining a resource hub dedicated to Ethereum Localism—one that could reflect the diversity of local experiments while connecting them into a cohesive field of practice.

By the end of third GFEL, hosted in Boulder, CO in early 2025, the time was right to begin. The Knowledge Garden concept emerged as a fitting format for a decentralized knowledge commons, and the communities behind it began building.

## The Initiative  
**ethereumlocalism.xyz** is an open knowledge garden and action-oriented research hub dedicated to propagating the meme and practice of Ethereum Localism. It acts as a connective tissue between local blockchain-based efforts and the broader Ethereum ecosystem, offering stories, tools, and tactics that demonstrate how Ethereum can empower geolocated, regenerative and participatory communities.

The project engages a global network of builders, long-time Ethereum contributors, and local organizers. These participants come from urban, rural, and hybrid environments—all exploring how Ethereum tools can support land-based and community-centered living. By providing a name and home for this niche within Ethereum culture, the initiative offers digital commons for those building local-first futures.

- Steward a global network of locally-rooted Ethereum initiatives  
- Highlight stories of community practice, regeneration and resilience, and experimental governance  
- Make participation easy and open for aligned individuals around the world

## Building in Practice  
- **February 2025** — Initiative launches at GFEL Boulder  
- **April 2025** — Telegram group and initial site go live  

- Contributors organize online co-working sessions, async collaboration, and community calls  
- A dedicated channel for development fosters transparency and shared ownership  

Governance is informal yet participatory: decisions are made by the most engaged contributors through collective dialogue and shared visioning.

---

## Lessons & Challenges  
- **Challenge:** Building collaboratively and continually as project stewards across time zones, and around existing life obligations and constraints. 
- **Lesson:** You can just do things. Especially when you're connected to and an active participant within communities that share your values.  
- **Advice to Others:** Build what you believe in! Communities of Practice and Knowledge Gardens are powerful containers for shared learning and progressive action.
