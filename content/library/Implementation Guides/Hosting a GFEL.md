**The General Forum on Ethereum Localism (GFEL)** is a gathering space for builders, organizers, artists, and researchers exploring how Ethereum and peer to peer technologies can support thriving local communities. It’s an opportunity to convene in your city your greater cosmo-local network, hear from visionaries, neighbors, and aligned peers working at the intersection of tech and community, share grounded experimentation, and co-create new, peaceful pathways for place-based, Ethereum-powered coordination. 🕊️

> **By hosting a GFEL, you can directly help grow the movement of Ethereum Localism from your bioregion, while contributing back to a global commons of ideas, tools, and practices.**

**Steps to Hosting a GFEL**

1. Read through the GFEL Planning Guide to understand the event history, format, and organizer commitments: [**GFEL Planning Guide**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Cwsk4MaRzYysADmczofbqSRcyvtvCugc360KoDlCkc/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Reach out to share your interest in hosting via the [Ethereum Localism Telegram chat](https://t.me/+5Enk4J4d98MyMDkx).
