**The General Forum on Ethereum Localism (GFEL)** is a gathering space for builders, organizers, artists, and researchers exploring how Ethereum and peer to peer technologies can support thriving local communities. It’s an opportunity to convene in your city your greater cosmo-local network, hear from visionaries, neighbors, and aligned peers working at the intersection of tech and community, share grounded experimentation, and co-create new, peaceful pathways for place-based, Ethereum-powered coordination. 🕊️

> **By hosting a GFEL, you can directly help grow the movement of Ethereum Localism from your bioregion, while contributing back to a global commons of ideas, tools, and practices.**

## Steps to Hosting a GFEL

1. Check out **Past GFEL Documentation: [Ethereum Localism Library > GFEL](library/GFEL)**.
2. Read the [**GFEL Planning Guide**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Cwsk4MaRzYysADmczofbqSRcyvtvCugc360KoDlCkc/edit?usp=sharing) to understand the event’s unique format, community values, and organizer roles and commitments.
3. Share your interest in hosting by reaching out via the [**Ethereum Localism Telegram chat**](https://t.me/+5Enk4J4d98MyMDkx) — it’s the best place to connect with fellow GFEL organizers before you begin planning.
4. Plan, execute, and document your GFEL!
