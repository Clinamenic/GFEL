Welcome! **ethereumlocalism.xyz** is an open knowledge garden and action-oriented research hub dedicated to propagating the meme and practice of Ethereum Localism.

**Ethereum Localism** bridges digital innovation with real-world impact through community-driven initiatives, enabling resilient and sustainable local economies powered by blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies. Tools and mechanisms like quadratic funding, local stablecoins, and decentralized governance and finance expand Ethereum’s utility beyond digital spaces to create tangible local impacts.

This movement and knowledge hub only exist with your participation - check out the resources here on the site, and get involved!

## Featured Resource: GFEL Boulder 2025 Video Recap

The most recent gathering of [a General Forum on Ethereum Localism (GFEL) in Boulder](library/GFEL/GFEL-2025-Boulder-Documentation) was more than a conference—it was a living inquiry into how we build and sustain systems of coordination, community, and care in a time of both precarity and possibility.

As you’ll see in the recap, Ethereum Localism is not a fixed ideology, rather it's a collaborative design space—where tools like DAOs, local currencies, and cosmo-local infrastructure are combined with deeply rooted local action to be wielded not for profit alone, but in service of regeneration, reciprocity, and collective resilience.
