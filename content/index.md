Welcome to the **Open Mutualism Archive**. 

**Open Mutualism Archive** is a network of humanities research exploring mutualism in the context of new media, new labor and distributed ledger technology. Our work takes the form of two exploratory tracks: ***economic* mutualism**, or the array of tactics for positive sum economic relationships between actors, and [***weird* mutualism**](https://www.openmutualism.xyz/Weird-Mutualism), the extension of those strategies to the realm of the nonhuman and the speculative. Our **comparative track** represents selective comparative studies between the two trajectories to the end of a new and practically applicable **open mutualism**.

Being a mere support vector for the autonomous efforts of our members, this archive has no editorial intention or oversight, but rather represents an immutable catalogue or mirror of our work. Being an abstraction of the broader Knowledge Commons initiated by [Open Civics](https://opencivics.co), this archive is a node in a network of research and resources for an open future.

Our aspiration is to collate the contributors of this archive into an autonomous Guild, **OMG**. Read the proposal for the **Open Mutualism Guild** [here](https://www.openmutualism.xyz/OMG---Toward-an-Open-Mutualism).
