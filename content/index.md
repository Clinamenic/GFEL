title: Open Mutualism Archive
---
The **Open Mutualism Archive** is a repository of humanities research exploring mutualism in the context of open web values such as decentralization, institutional disaffiliation, open protocolization, peer production. 

Our work takes the form of two exploratory tracks: ***economic* mutualism**, or the array of tactics for positive sum economic relationships between people, and [***weird* mutualism**](https://www.openmutualism.xyz/Weird-Mutualism), the extension of those strategies to the realm of the nonhuman and the speculative, animal life, distributed or collective intelligences, and inorganic agencies of the kind artists work with.<details> <summary>*</summary> (To the extent that this second track is meant to provoke and uproot the more human centric frameworks into radical experimentation, the second sense of Open in Open Mutualism is "Open Ended.") </details> Our **comparative track** represents selective comparative studies between the two trajectories to the end of a new and practically applicable **open mutualism**.

Being a mere support vector for the autonomous efforts of our members, this archive has no editorial intention or oversight, but rather represents an immutable catalogue or mirror of our work. Being an abstraction of the broader Knowledge Commons initiated by [Open Civics](https://opencivics.co), this archive is a node in a network of research and resources for an open future.

Our aspiration is to organize the contributors of this archive into an autonomous guild, **OMG**. Read the proposal for the **Open Mutualism Guild** [here](https://www.openmutualism.xyz/OMG---Toward-an-Open-Mutualism).
