## How to Contribute

### About

Our knowledge garden is a [markdown-based](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) wiki, built using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). We generally use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to create and curate documents for our knowledge garden.

To contribute to this knowledge garden, you have two options: share resources with existing curators, or become a curator yourself. Once you've reached out we may ask for additional information or respond with some editorial comments, or we may post directly.

---
### Option 1: Share Resources

If you have a resource you’d like to submit but don’t want to join the GitHub repo, you can share a Google Doc or markdown file (please include the required metadata, noted in the "Authoring Content" section below) with one of the curators - email:

- **christypdx & exeunt:** [etherealforest.eth@protonmail.com](mailto:etherealforest.eth@protonmail.com)
- **Clinamenic:** [ssc@clinamenic.com](mailto:ssc@clinamenic.com)

---
### Option 2: Join the Repo

1. Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download), a Markdown editor we use for authoring.
2. Clone the repo: [https://github.com/Clinamenic/GFEL](https://github.com/Clinamenic/GFEL)
3. Open the `/content` folder in Obsidian as a vault.
4. Request GitHub access to push updates.
5. Create a pull request from `your-branch-name` to `main`.
6. Once accepted, your content will go live on the site.

## Authoring Content

### Licensing
Knowledge Garden publications by default will be licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0. Alternative licensing can be specified via metadata (see below). [About CC Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/)

### Metadata (Frontmatter)

Each Markdown file should begin with a metadata section that includes at least the minimum required information shared below. This helps categorize and sort content throughout the site. Additional metadata can be included at the submitter's discretion, examples below.

Here’s a full example:

```markdown
---
title: "Community Currencies in Chiapas"

```

### Metadata Field Reference

- `title`: The title of your piece
- `date`: Submission or publication date (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
- `author`: Your name or author name(s)

	- [View the Tag Index](/tag-index)

---
### Markdown Cheatsheet

Use standard [Markdown formatting](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to write your content. Obsidian provides helpful shortcuts, but any text editor will work.

---
### Content Architecture

Content lives in two main sections of the Knowledge Garden:

### Library

Add or edit Markdown notes related to relevant resources, experiments, and ideas. These live in the `Library/` folder.

### Resources

Add full Markdown versions of longer articles, papers, and essays. These go in the `Resources/` folder.

Feel free to propose new sections as the garden grows.
