## How to Contribute

### About

Our knowledge garden is a [markdown-based](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) wiki, built using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). We generally use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to create and curate documents for our knowledge garden.

---

## Get Started

To contribute to this knowledge garden, you have two options: share resources with existing curators, or become a curator yourself.

### Option 1: Share Resources

If you have a resource you’d like to submit but don’t want to join the GitHub repo, you can share a Google Doc or markdown file with one of the curators:

- **christypdx & exeunt:** [etherealforest.eth@protonmail.com](mailto:etherealforest.eth@protonmail.com)
- **Clinamenic:** [ssc@clinamenic.com](mailto:ssc@clinamenic.com)

One of the curators will add it to the Knowledge Garden. We may ask for additional information or respond with some editorial comments, or we may post directly.

---

### Option 2: Join the Repo

1. Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download), a Markdown editor we use for authoring.
2. Clone the repo: [https://github.com/Clinamenic/GFEL](https://github.com/Clinamenic/GFEL)
3. Open the `/content` folder in Obsidian as a vault.
4. Request GitHub access to push updates.
5. Create a pull request from `your-branch-name` to `main`.
6. Once accepted, your content will go live on the site.

## Authoring Content

### Metadata (Frontmatter)

Each Markdown file should begin with a metadata section. This helps categorize and sort content throughout the site.

Here’s a full example:

```markdown
---title: "Community Currencies in Chiapas"date: 2024-11-12author: "Sofia Martínez"tags:  - format/case-study  - place/rural  - theme/community-currency---
```

### Metadata Field Reference

- `title`: The title of your piece
- `date`: Submission or publication date (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
- `author`: Your name or author name(s)
- `tags`: A list of lowercase keywords to help with categorization
	- [View the Tag Index](/tag-index)

---

### Markdown Cheatsheet

Use standard [Markdown formatting](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to write your content. Obsidian provides helpful shortcuts, but any text editor will work.

---

### Content Architecture

Content lives in two main sections of the Knowledge Garden:

### Library

Add or edit Markdown notes related to relevant resources, experiments, and ideas. These live in the `Library/` folder.

### Resources

Add full Markdown versions of longer articles, papers, and essays. These go in the `Resources/` folder.

Feel free to propose new sections as the garden grows.
