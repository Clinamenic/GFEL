**Summary**  
urbe.eth began as a small Discord group for a few friends passionate about Web3. In just over a year, it became the go-to builder community in Italy, organizing regular meetups, launching a major hackathon, and showing up across Europe as a tight-knit, mission-driven crew. Their ethos: no speculation, only tech and collaboration.

## What You’d Need to Try This

- A core group of 3–4 committed organizers  
- A community platform (like Discord or Telegram)  
- A clear boundary: no speculation, just learning and building  
- A recurring IRL format (monthly talks, casual meetups, etc.)  
- A vibe of experimentation: open calls, self-organizing teams, collective ownership

---

## Repeatable Tactics

- **Start small and personal** – The first meetups were just friends sharing beers and interesting conversation.  
- **Decide everything together** – From the name to meetup formats, early members voted and participated directly.  
- **Stick to a purpose** – No price talk, only building. This created a clear culture from the start.  
- **Build reputation systems** – Soulbound tokens and Discord roles helped recognize commitment.  
- **Grow through presence** – Traveling together to Web3 events helped build bonds and visibility.  
- **Anchor the rhythm** – Monthly *urbetalks* created a repeatable, community-driven meetup format.
