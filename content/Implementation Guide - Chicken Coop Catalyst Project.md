This guide provides a detailed walkthrough for implementing the first Ground Game project - a chicken coop (or several in different backyards) that serves as both a demonstration of regenerative principles and a catalyst for further development.

## Project Overview

The Chicken Coop Catalyst is designed to:

- Create immediate food production capacity
