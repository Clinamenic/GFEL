title: Ethereum Localism Action Kit
---
The Ethereum Localism Action Kit is designed to help you bring the principles of Ethereum Localism to life in your community. Whether you're new to blockchain technology or an experienced developer, this kit provides practical tools, templates, and guidance to create local impact.

This kit is modular by design - you can use the parts that make sense for your community and adapt them to your local context. The goal is to empower you to experiment with new forms of local coordination, governance, and economic activity using Ethereum as infrastructure.
