# Ethereum Localism Action Kit

Welcome to the Action Kit! This is your starting point for implementing Ethereum Localism principles in your community. Whether you're a blockchain expert or new to the space, these resources will help you take meaningful action.

## Getting Started

### 1. Assess Your Community

Before diving into specific projects, take time to understand your community's:

- Existing assets and strengths
- Key needs and challenges
- Social dynamics and power structures
- Technical capacity and digital literacy

### 2. Build a Core Team

Ethereum Localism initiatives work best with diverse teams that bring together:

- Technical knowledge (blockchain, development)
- Community organizing experience
- Local institutional connections
- Project management skills
- Design thinking

### 3. Choose an Entry Point

Start with a focused project that matches your community's needs and capacity:

- **Community Garden DAO** - A simple but concrete project combining physical space with digital governance
- **Local Skills Exchange** - A platform for trading services using community tokens
- **Neighborhood Investment Fund** - Pooled capital for hyperlocal development
- **Commons Stewardship Group** - DAO structures for maintaining shared resources

## Implementation Guides

Each of these guides provides step-by-step instructions to help you implement specific Ethereum Localism projects:

- [Chicken Coop Catalyst Project](/implementation-guide-chicken-coop-catalyst-project) - Using small-scale agriculture as an entry point
- Neighborhood Placemaking DAO - Co-creating public spaces with transparent governance
- Community Token System - Designing and launching a local token with real utility
- Decision-Making Framework - Setting up inclusive governance processes

## Technical Resources

- Recommended tools for different community contexts
- Low-tech to high-tech implementation options
- Security considerations for community DAOs
- Privacy-preserving approaches to local coordination

## Community Support

- Monthly action kit workshop calls
- Regional support networks
- Technical assistance office hours
- Project documentation repository

Remember, Ethereum Localism is about experimentation and adaptation. Start small, document what you learn, and share your experience with others!
