title: Host an Ethereum Localism Event
---
You don’t need permission to gather your people and bring Ethereum Localism to life where you are. In fact, the movement depends on it.

Whether you’re drawn to convening a cozy discussion circle, starting a local Fun DAO, co-creating a bioregional unconference, or simply hosting a potluck with neighbors to explore new economic ideas—**what you bring is enough**. Your time, curiosity, creativity, and commitment to place are the most valuable assets we have. What you have to contribute, the movement needs.

**Start where you are, with what you have, and who you know.** We’ve assembled some tools and templates below to help spark and support your process—but there’s no one-size-fits-all. The real magic happens when people remix and adapt in ways that feel alive and relevant in their local contexts.
