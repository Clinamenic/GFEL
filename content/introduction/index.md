title: Introduction to Ethereum Localism
---

Ethereum Localism is a movement that combines the global power of blockchain technology with localized action to create tangible positive change in communities around the world.

## What is Ethereum Localism?

Ethereum Localism represents the intersection of blockchain innovation and local community organizing. It focuses on using Ethereum's decentralized infrastructure to empower local communities, enhance coordination, and build resilient social systems from the ground up.

Key principles include:

- **Decentralization**: Distributing power and decision-making to communities
- **Local autonomy**: Empowering people to shape their own environments
- **Global connection**: Building bridges between local initiatives worldwide
- **Regenerative design**: Creating systems that sustain and renew resources
- **Open innovation**: Sharing knowledge, tools, and solutions freely

## Our Mission

Our mission is to create a global network of locally-rooted initiatives that demonstrate how blockchain technology can enhance community resilience, regenerative practices, and participatory governance.
