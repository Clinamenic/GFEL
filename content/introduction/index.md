## What is Ethereum Localism?

Ethereum Localism represents a growing movement at the intersection of blockchain technology and local community empowerment. It explores how Ethereum's decentralized infrastructure can strengthen local economies, governance systems, and social networks.

Unlike many blockchain projects that focus primarily on global, borderless applications, Ethereum Localism emphasizes the importance of place, community, and local context. It recognizes that while the internet and blockchain technology have connected us globally, our daily lives remain deeply rooted in local geographies and communities.

**Key Principles**

- **Decentralization with Purpose**: Decentralization is not the goal in itself but a means to foster more equitable, resilient, and participatory local systems. Ethereum Localism resists the re-centralization of blockchain and Web3 technologies by ensuring these tools empower communities rather than recreate traditional power hierarchies.
- **Community Sovereignty**: Communities should have self-determination over their economies, governance, and digital infrastructures. Ethereum Localism supports empowering local groups to design and govern their own solutions using open-source, cosmo-local tools and practices, preventing capture by centralized authorities.
- **Regenerative Economics**: Economic systems should restore rather than extract value from communities and ecosystems. Ethereum Localism integrates regenerative finance (ReFi), commitment pooling, and cooperative economic models to create public goods and ensure local economies thrive in harmony with their environments.
- **Cosmo-Local Coordination**: "Design global, manufacture local." Ethereum Localism follows a cosmo-local approach, leveraging globally shared knowledge, designs, and protocols while anchoring governance, production, and decision-making at the local level. This principle ensures that global collaboration enhances, rather than undermines, local autonomy.
- **Technological Accessibility**: Blockchain and Web3 tools should be accessible to diverse communities regardless of technical expertise or economic resources. Ethereum Localism aims to embed technology into existing mutual aid networks, cooperative economies, and bioregional organizing, ensuring digital infrastructure serves real-world local needs rather than being an end in itself.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to steward a global network of locally-rooted initiatives that demonstrate how blockchain technology can enhance community resilience, regenerative practices, and participatory governance.
