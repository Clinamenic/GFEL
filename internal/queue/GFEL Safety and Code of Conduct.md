## Safety Best Practices

Attendee safety and wellbeing is our top priority. The Forum on Ethereum Localism aims to cultivate a space where all feel safe to be themselves and lend their unique perspective. In this spirit, we ask that all participants keep the following guidelines in mind:

### Personal Belongings

- Always be mindful of your personal belongings and aware of your surroundings.
- Ethereal Forest assumes no responsibility for lost, stolen, or damaged items. We encourage you to treat all personal and shared items with care. The venue will only be accessible during scheduled event hours, so please plan accordingly.

### Personal Safety

- While the surrounding neighborhood is generally safe, it's always a good idea to walk in groups of two or more. Event volunteers are always happy to walk with you to your transportation or the next event--just let us know.
- Being familiar with general de-escalation techniques and trauma-informed responses is encouraged (speaking slowly and calmly to an agitated person, reflecting their language to demonstrate understanding of their point of view, and avoiding physically aggressive body postures).

We believe that in most cases, we can all fill our shared needs for safety without involvement of the police, and it is also important to note that police response times can be delayed. For many reasons, it is best to deal with most situations by deescalating if possible and moving to a safe place.

### Venue

[Historic Alberta House(opens in a new tab)](https://www.albertahouse.org/) in NE Portland is an event space intended for all, with a focus on reaching and engaging voices from our community that have been disproportionately impacted by social, economic, and or racial injustices in oregon.

### Event Contacts

The best way to stay connected generally is through the Telegram group chat, so be sure to [join the Telegram(opens in a new tab)](https://t.me/+3XVnc4PfzRsxMDEx)

### COVID-19 Precautions

- We're following Federal guidelines for COVID, which are currently 'business as usual,' so please take the precautions that best suit your personal risk level.
- We'll keep airflow as open as possible to help keep conditions safe, and will let folks know if weather or other conditions mean open airflow is less accessible.
- Use of masks inside is not required.
- Being up-to-date on your Covid-19 vaccine and boosters is encouraged but not required.

## Code of Conduct

We value the participation of each member of the community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to one another throughout the event.

To make clear what is expected, all attendees and speakers at GFEL 2024 are required to abide by this Code of Conduct. *The Code of Conduct will be enforced throughout the event without exception.*

1. GFEL is a community gathering intended for collaboration and exchange of ideas. All attendees will abide by a code of active and continual consent in all affairs.
2. Attendees will refrain from harassment of any kind. Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal comments, or other offensive activity, in person or online in the context of the conference related to gender, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, physical appearance, race, religion, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
3. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If participants fail to comply they will be asked to leave the event.
4. Be careful and mindful of the words that you choose. Please be aware that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary comments can be offensive to those around you and will not be tolerated at GFEL.
5. If a participant engages in behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, the Organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including expulsion from current or future Ethereal Forest activities.
